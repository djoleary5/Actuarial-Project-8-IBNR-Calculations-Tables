# Actuarial-Project-8-IBNR-Calculations-Tables
Calculate the IBNR Reserve for 30 companies and create pivot tables to display data

#### Task 
#### Part 1:
I was given inputs for 30 different companies.  Each scenario has 8 separate forecast inputs to place in the calculator created in Project 7.

My task is to calculate the total IBNR reserve for each of the 30 companies given. That means in total, I’ll have 30 calculations to automate.

#### Part 1 Result

I will do this using the tool that I created in Project # 7 and also by using VBA programming to read the inputs for each company, run them through the calculator I created in Project 7, and finally populate the resulting IBNR Reserve total in column J.

The final workbook (aka  output) displays the total IBNR reserve values to the right of the corresponding data for that scenario. So, Column A through Column I have the inputs (given) and to the right of these columns (in column J) appear the calculated total IBNR reserve values

#### Part 2:
#### Pivot Tables
Create all pivot tables within one sheet of your workbook labeled “Pivot Tables”

Pivot Table 1: Coverage Type

Create a pivot table that shows the count of the coverage type as a percentage of the grand total. Change labels of the pivot table so they make sense to what the table represents.

Pivot Table 2: Average Reported Claims

Create a pivot table that shows the average reported claims of each month in the dataset (January – June) according to coverage type.

Pivot Table 3: Max IBNR Reserve

Create a pivot table that shows the max total IBNR reserve according to each coverage type. Hide grand totals from showing in table.

#### Part 2 Result
Each pivot table is displayed on a seperate tab in the workbook.
